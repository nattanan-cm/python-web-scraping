# Python Web Scraping
This repository contains a Python-based web scraper built using the Scrapy framework. The scraper is designed to collect book data from online sources, such as online bookstores and libraries. The collected data can include titles, authors, prices, publication dates, and other relevant information.


### Scrapy vs. BeautifulSoup
- Scrapy is a comprehensive Python framework designed for web scraping and crawling. It provides a full suite of tools for making HTTP requests, parsing web pages, and organizing data. Itâ€™s well-suited for complex and large-scale scraping projects.

- Beautiful Soup is a Python library focused on parsing HTML and XML documents to extract data. It is often used in combination with external HTTP clients, like requests, to handle the scraping part.

Choose BeautifulSoup for a simple way to scrape static HTML content from a web page quickly. Scrapy is ideal for large-scale web scraping that requires extracting content from multiple web pages.
